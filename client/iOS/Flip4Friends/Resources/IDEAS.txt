Challenge Mode

* Flip Count:
    As a hint: Show, how many times a tile was flipped when requesting help (counts as x (e.g., 5) moves)
    As a game mode: Each tile has to be flipped EXACTLY as often as in the generation process. Tiles have more states to visualize the rest-flips.

    A slide to the side of the board can be used to visualize the moves in the history

* Check auto player: Are the moves actually optimal? Factor count of pattern tiles in!!
