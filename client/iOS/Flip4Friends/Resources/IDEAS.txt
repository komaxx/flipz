* Extras, power-cards, ...: Break the lock, multiply times flipped (e.g., *2, *-1,)

* Racing mode: Measure time until solution of a puzzle (more puzzles), send as challenge to friend.

* [other game]: Take 4. The user is must flip exactly 4 tiles in an area of 3x3 until everything is white.

* Auto-reset after a set amount of moves ->

* Assign challenge stars based on
    + time
    + turns over par/minimum

* -> "Lights out", simple playable patterns, fields trigger moves

Compute difficulty:
* How many obviously valid moves are available (less == easier)
* Percentage of obviously valid moves that are part of a winning path (higher == easier)
* Average number of moves in winning paths (more == harder)


Challenge Parameters:
* Board size
* Number of patterns
* Maximum possible different solutions
* Maximum alternatives per decision
* Lock turns: 0,1,2,...
* Covered/obfuscated necessary moves! Its "black" until it was turned enough times
* Clear target color (e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...)
* Enable/disable rotate
* Enable/disable mirror
* Triggered in-between moves (triggered when flipping a tile, triggered after x moves)

    -> Emerging difficulty estimation
     * Number of decisions
     * Winning paths
     * Alternatives per decision
