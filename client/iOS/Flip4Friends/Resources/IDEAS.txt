* Extras, power-cards, ...: Break the lock, multiply times flipped (e.g., *2, *-1,)

* Racing mode: Measure time until solution of a puzzle (more puzzles), send as challenge to friend.

* Assign challenge stars based on time

* Generate from picture!


Compute difficulty:
* How many obviously valid moves are available (less == easier)
* Percentage of obviously valid moves that are part of a winning path (higher == easier)
* Average number of moves in winning paths (more == harder)


Challenge Parameters:
* Board size
* Number of patterns
* Maximum possible different solutions
* Maximum alternatives per decision
* Lock turns: 0,1,2,...
* Covered/obfuscated necessary moves! Its "black" until it was turned enough times
* Clear target color (e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...)
* Clear target pattern
* Enable/disable rotate
* Enable/disable mirror
* Triggered in-between moves (triggered when flipping a tile, triggered after x moves)


    -> Parameters of FFGame
     * State visibility (stays black until white)  ->  harder
     * Enable/disable rotate
     * Enable/disable mirror

    -> Parameters of FFBoard
     * Board Size
     * Lock turns
     * Tile behavior ((x+1)%2, max(x-1,0), (x+99)%100 )
     * Target Pattern
     * Triggered Moves

    -> Emerging difficulty estimation
     * Number of decisions
     * Winning paths
     * Alternatives per decision
