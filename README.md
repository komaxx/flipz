# Flipz

Flipz is a puzzle game for iOS where you put patterns on a grid to flip tiles. 
Includes lots of game mechanics (multi-flip, rotating patterns, time-blocked), a multi-player mode, 100 hand-crafted levels, tutorials, an automatic level generator, and a level editor.

Here's the official homepage: [Flipz](https://poroba.com/flip/flipz.php)

If you'd like to use some parts (or all) of it for some commercial project, please just ask. With the GPLv3, I just want to avoid that the game suddenly appears in 20 reskinned versions in the store, giving the original one a bad name.
